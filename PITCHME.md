# Keep it simple

---

- The first step towards implementing a full product is eliminating the biggest unknowns with small, experimental, proofs of concept.

---

# The big questions often include:
- Where is the required information coming from?
    - Are our users supplying it?
    - Is it available from an API?
    - Can we download a CSV from a government website?
    - Can we scrape a website for it?
- Is our domain model correct?
    - Did we identify all of the information we need to store to solve the problem?
    - Is our database architecture correct — i.e. are our tables and columns sufficient to store the information?
- Are we solving the right problem, or is an adjacent one more pressing?

---

- We usually throw away the code from 3 or 4 of these small experiments before we build out anything resembling the first real product.

---

- So, keep it simple!
- Don't complicate the codebase by planning 6 months worth of features ahead.
- What's the smallest thing you can build right now that will allow you to test one assumption?

---

- Chat with us during office hours to help select an idea (hopefully from among a handful) and scope it down to a good initial feature set.

---

- Let's use the [wayback machine](https://archive.org/web/) check out what the initial launches of some famous startups looked like.

<!-- # Airbnb -->

<!-- 
- Brian/Joe couldn't afford rent
- took a few pictures of their loft, created a web page and had 3 paying guests for a convention.

<!-- # Twitter -->

<!-- 

- original Twitter prototype was designed for internal users at Odeo as a way to send messages to other employees and view them on a group level.

Jack (an undergrad student) introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group during a company brainstorming session.

<!-- 

- built by Paul Bucheit at Google because he hated microsoft products (preferred linux) and needed a way to use email on a linux machine
- the v1 only worked for Paul's email
- he started sharing it with co-workers and added features as needed in order to convert people from outlook to gmail
- He usually showed up later in the day and he realized how important email was when one day gmail wasn't working and everyone in the office was staring at him when he showed up

<!-- # Facebook -->

<!-- 
- originally created the application as a universal directory (or facebook, as it is known at Harvard) for students at Harvard University

- previously created facemash and a study guide app he used to pass his Art History class
- re-used the code from these apps to create facebook

<!-- # Instagram -->

![bg contain](./assets/instagram.png)

<!-- 
- Instagram’s predecessor, Burbn, was initially designed to allow users to check-in and share their experiences at various locations with friends.

- The initial app, in Kevin Systrom's words, “felt cluttered and overrun with features”. Adoption was poor, and users found the app confusing.

- one feature, however, that users loved. Easy photo-sharing. 

- So Systrom made a tough choice. He took the Burbn MVP and completely overhauled it:
We went out on a limb, and basically cut everything in the Burbn app except for its photo, comment, and like capabilities. What remained was Instagram.

<!-- # Amazon -->

- Justin wanted to be famous (influencer)

<!-- # Reddit -->

![bg contain](./assets/reddit.png)

<!-- 

- created a bunch of fake users and commented on each other's posts

<!-- 

- Other search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, google analyzed the relationships among websites.
- "PageRank" determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site

- at one point the internet got too big for their indexing algorithm, so the search results weren't updated for months
- they had to innovate to create a solution
